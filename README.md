# COVID-19-RANDOM-WALK-SIMULATION
In this project, we developed a Class full of functions that simulate susceptible and infected people in the current COVID 19 situation. First we generated a square with dimensions specified, and generated blue and red dots within that square. Also we built functions that check the interaction between them since the dots are moving one-step either north, south,east o west direction from their last position. We generated plots as well, where we check how fast the infected people transmit the disease with a transmission probability of 0,9. Additionally we compare Random Walk model to analytical equations, we had to find Beta which is the effective contact rate and it was around 0.033-0.042, these depends on the moment we ran the model since we are generating some randomly values at some point which makes that not every time we get the same results. At the end we implemented inside the existed functions and class, some conditions that simulated if some people get vaccinated and others die, this last probability was set at 1%.
